# 20.02.2025
1. Report from Gabi's side:
   - connected to the HPC
   - downloaded the data
   - set up the folders
   - started on the EDA
   - send the GitHub repo link

# 13.02.2025 - Individual meeting with Amelia and Veronika
1. Discussed different approaches for the model training and testing:
  - using only simple features, extracted directly from the images for the training
  - using simple features + using democraphics data available in the meta data part of the dataset
  - using only demographics data for training

2. Features extraction
  - try with histograms
  - then try feature extraction with neural networks

3. For the model I will use random forest (just a suggestion)
   - will try to detect chest drains
  
4. Evaluation of the models
   â€“ evaluate biases on different models
   - for each model I will report not only perfromance metrics, but also training time (important for model evaluation)
   - after modle training -> plot histogram of posterior probability (best case scenario: increase)
   - metrics reloaded paper (dont read the whole paper, just the calibration metrics)
   - read Trine and Cathrine's master thesis for brief overview of 'Metrics reloaded' paper

# 06.02.2025 - Lab meeting
1. Find out about different projects and how the meetings are usually led

2. Should prepare for every meeting a presentation on what I have done since the last meeting

3. Share the repo and the Notion notes with Amelia and Veronika

4. No lab meeting on 13.02.2025

# 03.02.2025 - Individual meeting
1. Decided on weekly meetings: 
  - every Thursday 11:00 - 11:30
2. Decided on a deadline for the final draft
  - 30.04.2025

3. Discussed the use of HPC, needed datsets should be already in the cluster

4. A good practice - update the meeting agenda the day before so Amelia and Veronika coild have time to take a look at the code/question

5. In march Amelia would be on a holiday
