# 06.02.2025 - Lab meeting
1. Find out about different projects and how the meetings are usually led

2. Should prepare for every meeting a presentation on what I have done since the last meeting

3. Share the repo and the Notion notes with Amelia and Veronika

4. No lab meeting on 13.02.2025

# 03.02.2025 - Individual meeting
1. Decided on weekly meetings: 
  - every Thursday 11:00 - 11:30
2. Decided on a deadline for the final draft
  - 30.04.2025

3. Discussed the use of HPC, needed datsets should be already in the cluster

4. A good practice - update the meeting agenda the day before so Amelia and Veronika coild have time to take a look at the code/question

5. In march Amelia would be on a holiday
