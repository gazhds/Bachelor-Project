# 🫁 Bachelor Thesis – Detecting Pleural Effusion in Chest X-rays with Clinical Features

**Author:** Gabriela Zhelyazkova

## 📘 Project Overview

This thesis investigates how incorporating clinical features improves the diagnostic performance and calibration of machine learning models detecting pleural effusion from chest X-rays. The study evaluates two types of models—not with the goal of improving machine learning performance in general, but to understand the impact of **clinical feature inclusion** in classification models for pleural effusion. Similar methods could be tested for other chest X-ray-based disease detection tasks.

Models:
- **XGBoost**: Trained on tabular/clinical features only
- **ResNet-based deep learning**: Integrating image and tabular inputs

**Datasets:**
- **CheXpert** – Chest X-ray images with metadata  
- **CheXmask** – Segmentation masks of anatomical structures

## 🧪 How to Run the Code

> ⚠️ The project was conducted at ITU using high-performance computing (HPC); the data was provided by supervisors. Data is not included in the repository.

### Environment Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gazhds/Bachelor-Project.git
cd Bachelor-Project

# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
💡 **GPU is strongly recommended** for training deep learning models. Make sure CUDA and a GPU-enabled PyTorch or TensorFlow is installed.

📂 Note: When using PyTorch for training deep learning models, first check the CUDA (or the architecture the machine is using) version of the machine's GPU. Then, install the corresponding compatible version of PyTorch from the official installation guide.

---

📂 Note: The .csv file containing the full structured dataset is not included in the repository due to size limitations. However, the feature extraction scripts automatically generate a .csv file with the structured features used for model training.


### XGBoost Model

- Open `model_training.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
- This trains and evaluates XGBoost models using:
  - Non-clinical features
  - Clinical-only features
  - Full combined feature set
- Works with tabular data only (no images)

---

### Deep Learning Experiments (GPU)

These scripts run dual-branch models (CNN + MLP):

- `NN_train_exp1.py` – Non-clinical features + image
- `NN_train_exp2.py` – Clinical features + image
- `NN_train_exp3.py` – Full feature set + image

Launch any of them with:

```bash
python NN_train_exp1.py
```

Architecture:
- CNN (ResNet) branch processes images  
- MLP processes tabular features  
- Late fusion merges both for classification  

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

### Steps before training:

- **Label filtering**: Only "positive", "negative", and "uncertain" pleural effusion labels were used
- **Mask decoding**: CheXmask RLE encoded masks decoded into binary segmentation arrays
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Greyscale histogram
  - Harris corners
  - Lung asymmetry
  - Fluid intensity

### Handling Missing Values:

- **XGBoost**: Uses native missing-value support  
- **Deep Learning**: k-NN imputation with `k=5`

## 📊 Results Summary

| Model        | Configuration    | AUC   | Comments                     |
|--------------|------------------|-------|------------------------------|
| XGBoost      | Clinical Only     | 0.873 | Best performance overall     |
| ResNet-based | Combined features | 0.860 | Best among deep models       |
| PCA variants | Any config        | ↓     | Decreased performance noted  |

*PCA-based dimensionality reduction could be further researched.*

## 🔁 For Future Work

- Apply models to **external datasets** (e.g., MIMIC-CXR, VinDr)
